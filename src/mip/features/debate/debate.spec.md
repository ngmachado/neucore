# Debate Model Feature Specification

## Overview
The Debate Model is an adversarial reasoning framework that uses multiple AI providers to generate and critique solutions, leading to more robust outcomes. The system works by having one provider propose a solution while another challenges it, creating a structured debate that improves reasoning quality.

## Core Components

### 1. DebateManager
- Orchestrates the entire debate process
- Manages debate lifecycle (initialization, rounds, resolution)
- Configures debate parameters
- Records debate history

### 2. DebateParticipant Interface
- Defines methods required for debate participants
- Implemented by provider adapters
- Methods: propose, critique, respond, conclude

### 3. DebateSession
- Represents a single debate instance
- Contains context, topic, arguments, and state
- Tracks round history and provider contributions

### 4. DebateConfig
- Maximum rounds
- Time limits
- Confidence thresholds
- Resolution strategies
- Provider roles and weights

## Debate Process Flow

1. **Initialization**
   - Create DebateSession with original query/problem
   - Assign providers to roles (Proposer, Critic)
   - Set debate parameters

2. **Proposal Round**
   - Proposer analyzes problem
   - Generates solution with reasoning
   - Structures arguments with evidence

3. **Critique Round**
   - Critic reviews proposal
   - Identifies weaknesses, gaps, biases
   - Generates counter-arguments
   - Suggests alternatives

4. **Response Rounds**
   - Proposer addresses critiques
   - Refines or defends solution
   - Provides additional evidence

5. **Resolution**
   - Check for consensus
   - Evaluate argument quality
   - Apply resolution strategy
   - Generate final solution

## Integration with MIP

### Provider Interaction
- Use MIP's ProviderManager to access providers
- Register debate as an Intent handler
- Create provider-specific adapters for debate participation

### Plugin System
- Expose debate capability via DebatePlugin
- Allow customization via configuration
- Implement extension points for custom strategies

## Data Structures

### DebateArgument
```typescript
interface DebateArgument {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  evidence: string[];
  confidence: number;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### DebateRound
```typescript
interface DebateRound {
  id: number;
  proposerArguments: DebateArgument[];
  criticArguments: DebateArgument[];
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### DebateResult
```typescript
interface DebateResult {
  solution: string;
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  consensusReached: boolean;
  winningProvider?: string;
  summary: string;
}
```

## Performance Considerations
- Timeout mechanisms for non-responsive providers
- Caching strategies for repeated debates
- Logging and telemetry for performance analysis

## Error Handling
- Provider unavailability
- Timeout handling
- Fallback strategies
- Resolution deadlocks

## Future Extensions
- Multi-provider debates (>2 participants)
- Human-in-the-loop participation
- Learning from past debates
- Specialized debate strategies for different domains
