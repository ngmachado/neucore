## Tree of Thought (ToT)

### Overview
Tree of Thought reasoning extends Chain of Thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, creating a tree structure of thought processes. This allows for broader exploration of the solution space.

### Planned Features
- **Branching Exploration**: Create multiple branches at decision points
- **Evaluation**: Score branches to determine most promising paths
- **Pruning**: Eliminate low-quality branches early
- **Beam Search**: Maintain top-K branches at each step
- **Backtracking**: Return to previous decision points when needed

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
export class TreeOfThoughtReasoner extends BaseReasoner {
    getMethod(): ReasoningMethod {
        return ReasoningMethod.TREE_OF_THOUGHT;
    }

    async reason(query: string, options?: Partial<ReasoningOptions>): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
        // Initialize tree structure
        // Explore multiple reasoning paths
        // Score and prune branches
        // Select best path for conclusion
    }
    
    // Other supporting methods
}
```

## ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

### Overview
ReAct combines reasoning with action-taking in an alternating sequence, allowing for interaction with external environments or tools during the reasoning process.

### Planned Features
- **Action Integration**: Execute actions as part of reasoning
- **Observation Processing**: Incorporate observations from actions
- **Tool Usage**: Use tools and APIs to gather information
- **Feedback Loops**: Adjust reasoning based on action outcomes
- **Environment Interaction**: Model interactions with external systems

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
export class ReActReasoner extends BaseReasoner {
    getMethod(): ReasoningMethod {
        return ReasoningMethod.REACT;
    }

    async reason(query: string, options?: Partial<ReasoningOptions>): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
        // Initialize reasoning
        // Alternate between:
        //   - Reasoning steps
        //   - Action execution
        //   - Observation integration
        // Generate conclusion based on reasoning and actions
    }
    
    // Other supporting methods
}
```

## Socratic Method

### Overview
The Socratic Method uses a question-based approach to reasoning, continuously asking probing questions to refine understanding and reach conclusions.

### Planned Features
- **Question Generation**: Automatically generate relevant questions
- **Answer Analysis**: Process and analyze answers
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identify inconsistencies in reasoning
- **Belief Refinement**: Update beliefs based on question answers
- **Dialogue Structure**: Maintain coherent dialogue flow

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
export class SocraticReasoner extends BaseReasoner {
    getMethod(): ReasoningMethod {
        return ReasoningMethod.SOCRATIC;
    }

    async reason(query: string, options?: Partial<ReasoningOptions>): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
        // Initialize reasoning with main question
        // Generate probing questions
        // Answer questions
        // Analyze answers for insights
        // Generate conclusion based on Q&A process
    }
    
    // Other supporting methods
}
```

## First Principles Reasoning

### Overview
First Principles reasoning breaks down complex problems into their most fundamental components, then builds solutions from those basic elements.

### Planned Features
- **Decomposition**: Break problems into fundamental components
- **Assumption Identification**: Identify and challenge assumptions
- **Fundamental Truth Mapping**: Map out basic truths and principles
- **Bottom-up Solution Building**: Build solutions from fundamentals
- **Cross-validation**: Validate solutions against first principles

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
export class FirstPrinciplesReasoner extends BaseReasoner {
    getMethod(): ReasoningMethod {
        return ReasoningMethod.FIRST_PRINCIPLES;
    }

    async reason(query: string, options?: Partial<ReasoningOptions>): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
        // Decompose problem into fundamental components
        // Identify core principles relevant to the problem
        // Build solution from fundamental truths
        // Validate solution against principles
        // Generate conclusion
    }
    
    // Other supporting methods
}
```

## Reflexion

### Overview
Reflexion incorporates self-reflection and criticism into the reasoning process, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of thoughts.

### Planned Features
- **Self-evaluation**: Evaluate reasoning quality
- **Error Detection**: Identify flaws in reasoning
- **Refinement Cycles**: Iteratively improve reasoning
- **Metacognition**: Reason about the reasoning process itself
- **Learning**: Adjust reasoning approach based on past performance

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
export class ReflexionReasoner extends BaseReasoner {
    getMethod(): ReasoningMethod {
        return ReasoningMethod.REFLEXION;
    }

    async reason(query: string, options?: Partial<ReasoningOptions>): Promise<ReasoningResult> {
        // Generate initial reasoning
        // Critically evaluate reasoning quality
        // Identify potential errors or weaknesses
        // Refine reasoning based on reflection
        // Repeat reflection cycle as needed
        // Generate final, refined conclusion
    }
    
    // Other supporting methods
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Complete and refine Chain of Thought implementation (current)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Tree of Thought and ReAct reasoners
3. **Phase 3**: Implement Socratic and First Principles reasoners
4. **Phase 4**: Implement Reflexion reasoner
5. **Phase 5**: Develop hybrid approaches combining multiple methods

## Integration Considerations

When implementing these reasoners, consider integration with:

- **Memory System**: Access and update long-term memory
- **Context Building**: Incorporate relevant context
- **Action System**: Integration with the action system for ReAct
- **Goal Management**: Alignment with user goals
- **External Knowledge**: Access to external knowledge sources

## Advanced Features for All Reasoners

These advanced features should be implemented across all reasoning methods:

- **Uncertainty Handling**: Explicitly represent and reason with uncertainty
- **Bias Detection**: Identify and mitigate cognitive biases
- **Explanability**: Generate human-understandable explanations
- **Performance Tracking**: Track reasoning performance over time
- **Multi-modality**: Reasoning across text, images, and structured data
