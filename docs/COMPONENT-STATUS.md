## Known Limitations

- **Memory System**: Limited embedding caching
- **Context Builder**: No advanced priority weighting 
- **Action System**: Basic permission checks only
- **RAG System**: Limited chunking strategies
- **Model Providers**: Missing streaming support in some providers
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent across modules

## Upcoming Changes

Major changes planned for future versions:

1. Complete OpenAI provider implementation
2. Implement additional reasoning methods
3. Enhance error handling and validation
4. Add proper telemetry and observability
5. Implement missing database adapters
